# AgriDoc
Autonomous agricultural robot with NVIDIA Jetson Nano at its core. This provided the robot with strong computational power for real time image processing and to use ROS at the same time to make the robot autonomous.


**Part1:**
- To build an autonomous robot using Jetson Nano.
- Carry out Real Time Image Classification using Jetson Nano.
- Partly run the robot on solar energy.

**Part2:**
- Build a disease and weed detection system for real time application.
- Using the autonomous attribute of the robot carry out weedicide/fertilizer spraying mechanism wherever required in the field.
- Build a humidity-temperature monitoring system that helps in predicting diseases.
- Carry out all the processes using a GUI.
