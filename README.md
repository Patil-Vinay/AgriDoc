# AgriDoc
Basically this is my final year project. This project is to be carried out for almost 1 year and therefore it is divided into 2 parts.

**Part1 Objectives:**
- To build an autonomous robot using Jetson Nano.
- Carry out Real Time Object Detection using Jetson Nano.
- Partly run the robot on solar energy.

**Part2 Objectives:**
- Build a disease and weed detection system for real time application.
- Using the autonomous attribute of the robot carry out weedicide/fertilizer spraying mechanism wherever required in the field.
- Build a humidity-temperature monitoring system that helps in predicting diseases.
- Carry out all the processes using a GUI.
