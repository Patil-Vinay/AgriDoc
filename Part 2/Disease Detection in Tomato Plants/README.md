## Disease Detection in Tomato Plants
Our aim was to buld a deep learning model that would detect and classify various tomato diseases commonly found. This classification was done using CNN with the help of TensorFlow and achieved an accuracy of almost 97%


## WorkFlow

- Import required dependencies
- Preprocess the images to prepare the dataset
- Split the dataset into training set ,test set and validation set.
- Prefetch and cache the data
- Augment the data
- Build the CNN model
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model.
- Make Predictions.
